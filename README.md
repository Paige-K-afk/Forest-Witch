# Forest-Witch
Forest witch is a stealth horror inspired game, combining my favourite parts of the gameplay of FNAF: Security Breach with aesthetics inspired by Inscrypion and various DS titles, that was developed as my coursework for the Game Behaviour module at the University of derby.

# A brief description of the game. 
You are a forest witch.
All of your animal friends have started acting weird, but if you can make it to your grotto, you can cast a spell to fix this.
This is a simple stealth game
The animals (Enemies) have patrols; you need to avoid them.
Wolves will kill you (send you back to the start), birds will allert wolves to your presence.
Water is a hazard (but won't consume a life, so follow that log into the river and see what that submerged bridge does). If you go above the waist in water, you'll be swept back to the start.
You have 4 lives. Dropping to zero lives will set you to game over (going into water does not consume a life).


# A list of all controls for the game. 
WASD - Move
Space - Jump
Esc or L - reset player position to spawn (only use when stuck, unless you want to go back to the start)
Run into things to move them. Just shove objects that you think can be shoved.
